                This was the first real art work that I had ever made. I made it when I was in 7th grade or evern lower like 5th Grade. I can remember before I made the picture I was so excited to start ot becuase at that point we had just started to play our musical instruments. I chose the saxophone because it was something that my mom had done and I wanted to play the same instrument as her. Of all art that I have ever made this one is so far my favoirate. I think that it is becuase of the background and the work that I had put into it made my apperciate it so much more than anything else I have ever done.

            This peice was actually a piece that I had done for class in the fall semster for my 3D design course the funny thing is that I had thought that the course was going to be about computers like hwo to edit photos and how to make cool things on the computer but as it turned out, the class was actaully about makin art work that was 3D. Although it was not what I had intended the class to be I still had fun while I was doing it. This Draogn Fly was the first big project that we had to do. I really enjoyed the process of making it with the wire although it was greasy. I also really enjoyed how it had tunred out, so I decided on kepping it after the class was over.

                This Project was an intresting one like the Dragon above this was a a piece that I had done for the D design class in the fall. This project unlike the the Dragon Fly was due in less then three weeks. It was out job to recreate something that we could find in the woods with sticks and branhes. At first I though it would be an easy project but it was had to recreat the natural inclosures that I found when I was outside. I close to look at the trees that grow in the everglades I modeled my project off the roots that stick out of the water to form thier ouwn inclosures. Where I imgined fish and crabs would live, or reproduce.
